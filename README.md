### Problem Statement

The DVD rental store is facing challenges in understanding customer behavior and rental trends. Without clear insights into when and what customers prefer to rent, the store struggles to optimize inventory, tailor marketing strategies, and enhance customer satisfaction. The primary issues include:
*	Unpredictable Rental Patterns: The store cannot accurately forecast high-demand periods and identify seasonal trends.
*	Lack of Genre Preferences: Unclear understanding of which movie genres are most popular.
*	Customer Spending Habits: Inadequate knowledge of customer spending patterns and high-value customers and it Harmful targeted marketing efforts and loyalty programs.
*	Unidentified Customer Segments: The inability to segment customers based on rental behavior and demographics.

### Introduction

Welcome to the DVD Rental Store Analysis project. This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of customer behavior and rental trends in a hypothetical DVD rental store, using the Sakila database from MySQL. Our goal is to provide actionable insights through detailed data analysis and visualization using Power BI, enabling better business decisions and customer engagement strategies.

### Project Overview

This project involved the following key steps:
1.	Data Cleaning: Checked for and handled missing values across all tables to ensure data completeness.
2.	Data Type Conversion: Converted columns to appropriate data types (dates, numeric, categorical) for accurate analysis.
3.	Data Transformation: Created date-based columns (Year, Month, Weekday, Weekend) for trend analysis.
4.	Data Modeling: Established relationships between tables (Rentals, Payments, DVDs, Customers) to form a unified dataset.
5.	DAX Calculations: Set up calculated columns and measures (Total Rentals, Total Spending, Rental Duration, Genre Preferences) in Power BI for in-depth insights.
6.	Analysis and Insights: Analyzed rental patterns, durations, genre popularity, customer spending, and segmentation.
7.	Recommendations: Provided strategic recommendations based on the analysis to enhance business outcomes.
